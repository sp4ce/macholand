# Macho Land

Mobile application of the MachoLand website. It uses the Ionic framework, which is
base upon Cordova framework. Please visit http://ionic.io for instructions on the
installation.

# Cordova Plugin dependencies

In order to make the application work, you need some cordova plugins. In the root
folder of your project, run these commands:

    cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.camera`
    cordova plugin add https://github.com/sp4ce/send-mail-cordova-plugin.git`

# Run on android

First you need to add the android platform (you do this only one time) and then
start to emulate on any android device. See the Android SDK documentation for
more information.

    ionic add platform android
    ionic emulate android

# Run on IOS
